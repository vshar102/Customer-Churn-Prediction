# Customer-Churn-Prediction for Subscription-Based Services

🎯 Project Overview
Developed advanced predictive analytics system enabling proactive customer retention strategies through accurate identification of at-risk subscribers, transforming reactive customer service into strategic retention management.

💼 Business Problem
Subscription services faced significant revenue losses from customer churn with limited visibility into churn predictors, making proactive retention efforts impossible and increasing customer acquisition costs while reducing lifetime value.

🔧 Technical Solution
Implemented comprehensive machine learning pipeline with data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features), feature selection, and three algorithms: Logistic Regression for interpretable binary classification, Decision Tree for feature-based decision mapping, and Random Forest ensemble for robust predictions. Explored both Churn Label (binary classification) and Churn Score (probability-based) approaches for nuanced churn risk understanding.

📊 Key Results
Logistic Regression: 100% accuracy, ROC AUC 1.0, perfect precision/recall/F1-score
Decision Tree: 100% accuracy, ROC AUC 1.0, perfect classification metrics
Random Forest: 92.19% accuracy, ROC AUC 1.0, precision 0.88, recall 1.0, F1-score 0.92

💰 Business Impact
Enabled targeted retention strategies, optimized resource allocation for high-risk customers, and created foundation for personalized marketing campaigns. Demonstrated machine learning's power in predicting customer behavior for strategic decision-making and long-term business growth.
